Problem Statement for Assignment 2
You are given the stock price till the (t-1)^th day and you need to predict whether the stock price would go up,down or would remain sideways on the t^th day,
So the current state is the close price list till the (t-1)-day  and the number of stocks we have purchased on this time stamp
Your action would be:
You should buy the stock(which means we predict the stock price to go up)
You should sell the stock(which means we predict the stock price to go down)
You should hold on the position (which means do nothing)
First of all there a few variables
MAX_TRANSACTIONS = k, maximum number of time we can do a buy after a selling
TOTAL_MONEY = k2 , total money that we have in cash(virtual ) 
CURRENT_STOCKS_BOUGHT = k3 , the number of stocks we have bought currently
CURRENT_TRANSACTION_COUNT = k4, number of buys done before selling - You can only do the buy if CURRENT_TRANSACTION_COUNT<MAX_TRANSACTIONS
Whenever you do a buy the amount with which you buy the stocks are x= TOTAL_MONEY/(MAX_TRANSACTIONS- CURRENT_TRANSACTION_COUNT)  and the number of stocks bought in this buy signal = x/STOCK_PRICE at that moment.
Whenever you do sell just increase your TOTAL_MONEY by CURRENT_STOCKS_BOUGHT*STOCK_PRICE and do the CURRENT_TRANSACTION_COUNT=0
Now when to do a buy or when to do the sell:
Do the buy whenever there is a buy signal and when CURRENT_TRANSACTION_COUNT<MAX_TRANSACTIONS
When there is a sell signal from DQN , just sell any stocks if you had purchased if any
When there is a hold signal , do nothing
Reward: It is the profit or the loss that happens in any transactions
DataSet: Use the 2009 January-2017 December data for training and then use the 2018 January-2019 December data to do the test(and report the profits made in it)



Here are some more details for the reward function:
If you are doing the trade then reward = profit / loss in that transaction
If your are not holding any stock then your reward function should penalise if there was a  profit earning opportunity and it missed it. Similarly it should get positive reward it there was a loss occurring and your model did not do any trade
